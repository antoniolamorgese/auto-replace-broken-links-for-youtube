Auto Replace Broken Links For Youtube automatically replaces all broken or invalid YouTube video links in your posts to improve SEO and always ensure your authority on search engines. All Plugin activity is performed in asynchronous mode.

== Description ==

Auto Replace Broken Links For Youtube monitors and checks all broken or unreachable Youtube video links on your website. Automatically replaces all YouTube video links by restoring them to improve SEO and user experience.
Once installed, the plugin, while viewing a post, will start analyzing the content and looking for any broken YouTube video links. Once the analysis is finished, the plugin will start checking each link to verify its validity.
Broken links, if detected, will be replaced with other youtube links, searched independently, based on the key phrase of the post. This is to prevent search engines from penalizing your content. The plugin will send an email to the administrator to notify the result of the operation. All Plugin activity is performed in asynchronous mode.
